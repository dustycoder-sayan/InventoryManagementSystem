This is an Inventory Management System project, aimed at manaaging the various inventories of a company. 
To run the project, follow the following steps:
1. Open the InventoryUI file in a renowed editor or IDE having JDK 11, JDBC SQLite and JavaFX plugged in.
2. Navigate to the LoginPage.java file location by following the path:
   src -> main -> java -> com -> inventoryui -> LoginPage
3. Run the file

The opened page is the LoginPage for the system. On entering a valid username and password, a user (admin or employee - seller) of the organization is logged in. 
They can then use the system to gain the sales report, view and sell products, and so on as required.
